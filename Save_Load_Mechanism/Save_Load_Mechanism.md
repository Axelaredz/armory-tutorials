# Save/Load Mechanism

Let create save/load mechanism for our game! We should be able to save and load object location/rotation and some other thing at the end of tutorial.

This tutorial is divided into 3 parts:
1. We will setup the mechanism, that is we will only look into writing and reading file in-game.
2. We will finally add saving and loading cube's Location and Rotation.
3. We will close this tutorial by adding UI for saving and loading for more gamey experience.
