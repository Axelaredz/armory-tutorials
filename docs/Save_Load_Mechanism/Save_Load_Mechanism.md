# Save/Load Mechanism

Let create save/load mechanism for our game! We should be able to save/load object location/rotation and save/load using UI.

This tutorial is divided into 3 parts:
1. We will setup the mechanism, in this we will only look into writing and reading file in-game.
2. We will finally add saving and loading cube's Location and Rotation.
3. We will close this tutorial by adding UI for saving and loading for more gamey experience.

at the end of this tutorial you should get this:
