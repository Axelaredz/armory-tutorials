# Common Pitfalls/Misconceptions

**-> I choosed `EEVEE`/`Cycles` renderer but still get this error.**

It doesn't matter which renderer you select, Armory has it own renderer, and `EEVEE`/`Cycles`/`Workbench` aren't used at all by Armory.

**-> I am using Blender 2.7...**

Let me stop you right there, Armory now uses Blender 2.8 and support for Blender 2.7X is dropped, If you want to use Blender 2.7x, you will have to use Armory version < 0.6, you can find it [here](https://github.com/armory3d/armory/releases). So, move on like I did.

**-> I made changes to my game. Why donâ€™t they show up when I start the game?**

Armory caches builds of the game. Sometimes you need to clean this cache, click `Clean` button next to `Play` button under `Scene Tab` in `Armory Player`, and you are good to go!
