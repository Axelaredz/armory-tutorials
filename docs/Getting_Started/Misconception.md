# Common Misconceptions

List of Common Misconceptions in Armory:
* I choosed `EEVEE`/`Cycles` renderer but still get this error. It doesn't matter which renderer you select, Armory has it own renderer, and `EEVEE`/`Cycles`/`Workbench` aren't used at all by Armory.
* I am using Blender 2.7..., let me stop you right there, Armory now uses Blender 2.8 and support for Blender 2.7X is dropped, If you want to use Blender 2.7x, you will have to use Armory version < 0.6, you can find it [here](https://github.com/armory3d/armory/releases). So, move on like I did.
