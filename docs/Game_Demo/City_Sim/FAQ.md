### -> WHY TUTORIAL FOR CBS GAME, NOT FPS OR SOMETHING ELSE?
You might be wondering, why tutorial for CBS game in particular and not something like FPS game? Well, that because of following reasons:
- **Boringgggg!!!**: FPS game tutorial are really common type of tutorial among game dev community, I mean there already exists video and text tutorial for `Armory3D` game engine. so, I find it boring to create another one.
- **Unique**: Tutorial for CBS game are rare, some people might be wondering about how it work inside, so I thought why not.

- **Simple**: Small CBS game are simple enough to make and understand.
