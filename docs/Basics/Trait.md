There are 4 different types of traits:
1. **Haxe Trait**: [Haxe](https://haxe.org/) scripting trait that can be used to write game logic in.
2. **Logic Nodes Trait**: It is visual scripting trait that can also be used to write game logic in, it is similar to [UE4's Blueprints](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Engine/Blueprints/index.html).
3. **Canvas Trait**: This is trait for UI, canvas can be made using [Armory2D](https://github.com/armory3d/armory2d), but you can create it yourself with Armory2D as canvas use `.json`.
4. **[WebAssembly(WASM)](https://webassembly.org/)**: This is also scripting trait, you can write your game logic in [`Rust`](https://www.rust-lang.org/)/[`C`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29)/[`C++`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) and than compiling the code to `WASM` to use it in Armory.
